DESCRIPTION: RESPONSIVE-PORTFOLIO-WEBSITE
This HTML code represents a simple personal portfolio web page for "G Deepika." The page is styled with a cyan background and features a centered header titled “Welcome to My Portfolio.” It includes navigation buttons for sections like About, Skills, and Contact (currently using empty links). The main content introduces the individual with a name, photo (myimage.jpg), and a short paragraph describing her passion for front-end web development. It also lists educational background and technical skills such as Python, Java (OOP), CSS, C, and basics of Machine Learning in an ordered list.

The "Languages Known" section uses an unordered list to highlight spoken languages like Telugu, Kannada, and Tamil. At the bottom, there's a contact form inviting users to get in touch. The form collects basic information including name, email, gender, interests (like coding or reading), and a short bio. While functional in layout, some improvements like correcting typos, using valid HTML practices, and ensuring input fields have name and id attributes would enhance accessibility and usability. Overall, it's a good foundational portfolio template for a beginner in web development.
